```{setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#Install Packages
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
```

```{r}
#Load data
hfi <- readr::read_csv("https://www.openintro.org/data/csv/hfi.csv")
```

1.  What are the dimensions of the dataset? What does each row
    represent? `hfi` has 1458 rows and 123 columns. Each row represents a country's observation.
```{r}
#Dimensions
dim(hfi)
```

```{r}
hfi_2016 <- hfi %>% filter(year == 2016)
```
2.  What type of plot would you use to display the relationship between
    the personal freedom score, `pf_score`, and `pf_expression_control`?
    Since they are continous variables, I would use a scatterplot.
    
```{r}
#Plot a scatterplot

hfi_2016 
```
